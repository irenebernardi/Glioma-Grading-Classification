# Glioma-Grading-Classification

This project focuses on accurately categorizing the grade of a particular type of brain tumor, specifically gliomas. To do so, we use the dataset provided by [The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)](https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga). The dataset utilized is sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). 
The strategy involves exploring possible dimensionality reduction methods, identifying the most effective model from a range of classifiers and enhancing its performance through various techniques, such as grid search and other optimization methods.

## What are gliomas? 
Gliomas are tumors of the glial cells of the central nervous system. 

 Table 1 illustrates glioma types and grades, as per the World's Health Organization definitions:
