# Glioma-Grading-Classification

This project focuses on accurately categorizing the grade of a particular type of brain tumor, specifically gliomas. To do so, we use the dataset provided by [The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)](https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga). The dataset utilized is sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). 
The strategy involves exploring possible dimensionality reduction methods, identifying the most effective model from a range of classifiers and enhancing its performance through various techniques, such as grid search and other optimization methods.

## What are gliomas? 
Gliomas are tumors of the glial cells of the central nervous system. 

 Table 1 illustrates glioma types and grades, as per the World's Health Organization definitions:

## Dataset description 
gene by gene description 

**IDH1**: this gene provides instructions to make the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 enzyme, ultimately protecting cells from oxidative stress. IDH1 mutations can lead to onco-metabolite 2HG production, which contributes to glioma formation. 

**TP53**: this gene provides instructions to create a tumor suppressor protein called p53. Protein p53 regulates cell division and prevents excessive and uncontrolled cell proliferation. Mutations on the TP53 gene can lead to dysfunctional activity of the p53 protein, thus disrupting its tumor suppressing role.

**ATRX**: this gene plays an important role in chromatin remodeling, thus regulating expression of other genes and preventing chromosomal instability. Its exact role in tumor development is not entirely clear. 

**PTEN**: This gene encodes for a protein phosphatase that promotes cell survival and genomic stability. Its tumor suppressing properties derive from the negative regulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which can go awry in case of mutations.
